            <p>A collection of thoughts on causality, the void, and the physics of the absolute. There is no fundamental law in this causeless Universe. Everything is emergent from nothing. </p>
            These come from my research journey that began during my visits to BARC, Mumbai, then in Europe at UBFC Dijon, AEI Hannover and University of Luxembourg.

                <p>
                    <strong>An alternative approach to the Theory of Everything.</strong><br>
                    Here, gravity is not quantizable. Quantum fields emerge in a causally connected regime outside the black hole event horizon—a regime that allows simultaneity at a distance. Inside a black hole, simultaneity is forbidden. This approach is inspired by Freeman Dyson's comment on approaching Gravito-Quantum and why not Qunatum Gravity

                    <h3>Consequences of the Theory</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Phenomenal Universe:</strong> The universe is not an object but a phenomenon, where natural processes assume the path of causality minimization.</li>
                        <li><strong>Definition of Physical:</strong> "Physical" is anything that exists within a causally connected regime as a consequence of allowed simultaneity and entanglement at a distance. Inside a blackhole this spooky action can no longer happen at a distance due to the causal disconnetedness of the background. Creating a regime of vaccuum of physical laws, which is the real vacuum or nothingness/nullity. This not the same as nothing of quantum vacuum as proposed by Lawrence Krauss.</li>
                        <li><strong>Information Destruction:</strong> Black holes help in the destruction of information. Information, like matter, only emerges in a causally connected spacetime.</li>
                        <li><strong>Black Hole Growth:</strong> Black holes do not evaporate; instead, they evaporate the spacetime outside the event horizon, constantly increasing in size even in an isolated universe.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dark Sector Memory:</strong> Dark matter represents the <em>intrinsic memory effect of relation</em> (entanglement is a direct instantaneous dark matter memory effect). Dark energy represents the <em>extrinsic memory effect of unrelation</em>. The young galaxies have almost no dark matter like DF2 and old galaxies like Candidate Dark Galaxy-2 (CDG-2) has mostly dark matter. As with time more memory gets accumulated. </li>
                        <li><strong>Zero Causality:</strong> Net causality of Universe is 0 in an eternal universe which lacks a unique beginning like a Big Bang singularity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Emergence of Time:</strong> Simultaneity allows co-motion (dynamics). When matter forms chunks on a causally connected manifold, quantum mechanics and fields naturally emerge alongside emergent time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Time Dilation:</strong> Time appears to move slowly as we move fast because simultaneity becomes difficult to achieve. At the event horizon, time ceases to exist, stripping the information it carried.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>The Shutdown Process: Determinism & Completeness</h2>
                <p><em>"You cease to exist the day you understand the truth"</em></p>
                
                <p>An inquiry into the nature of determinism, which arises from the fact of complete predictability and complete understanding. By challenging the "myth of isolation," this research explores how a completely self-aware observer realizes a deterministic shutdown.</p>

                    <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Deterministic Shutdown:</strong> A process where a machine is shut down exactly at a desired time, neither before nor after.</li>
                        <li><strong>Information Completeness:</strong> To perform a deterministic shutdown, one must possess complete information regarding all variables of the machine.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Myth of Isolation:</strong> Systems cannot be truly isolated; assuming isolation creates artificial pseudo-boundaries that lead to uncertainty.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nature as Observer:</strong> Nature interacts within itself as a connected system, and the observer is merely a sub-part of this un-isolatable whole.</li>
                        <li><strong>Natural Solutions:</strong> Nature does not solve problems but follows the path of the solution itself.</li>
                    </ul>
