            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                This paper proposes that Nature operates as a "causality killing machine" within an overall Null-Universe. 
                It presents a no-boundary, no-unique-beginning proposal for the universal phenomenon. 
                Fundamental concepts such as time and mass are argued to be non-absolute, arising solely from our limited scope and dissolving to nullity at infinite or zero scope.
            </p>

            <h3>Core Arguments</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dark Matter & Energy:</strong> These are not particles or fields. Instead, Dark Matter is an effective weight portraying the lineage towards an <em>intrinsic</em> pathway to minimize causality. Dark Energy is the <em>extrinsic</em> pathway to the same goal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    [cite_start]<strong>Black Holes:</strong> Described as "saints among us mortals". They always expand and evaporate external space-time via Hawking radiation, which effectively kills causality in the surrounding space-time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Mismatch Model:</strong> Matter evolves through a natural progress towards nullity. [cite_start]A material is never complete; it transforms until it reduces to gravitational waves and photons by meeting its exact counterpart.
                </li>
            </ul>
