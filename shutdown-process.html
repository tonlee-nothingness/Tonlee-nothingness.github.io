        <p>This essay is on the idea of determinism and completeness when trying to realize determinism.</p>

        <h3>Determinism</h3>
        <p>Determinism by itself emphasises the fact of complete predictability. We loosely understand that complete predictability arises from complete understanding.</p>

        <p>What is understanding and what it precisely means when we talk about it from the point of view of a scientist. As a scientist you often have to limit (or delimit) yourself to the exactness of the interpretation of the proposal. We need to understand what exactness means and in science it is often important to define the context with precision.</p>

        <p>A context is the background or mathematically the space that allows one to embed the system in hand to study. Whitney embedding theorem describes a rule about the dimension of the space required to embed an object of a finite dimension. The rule emphasises that a minimum $N$ dimensional space is required to embed a $N-1$ dimensional object.</p>

        <p>Coming to determinism, we understand that a system needs to deterministic if we can know all its features during any instant of its evolution.</p>

        <h3>Deterministic Shutdown</h3>
        <p>What if you are tasked to deterministically shutdown a machine in exactly say 5 seconds? How would you do that? Would you be able to figure out how? What do you need to know in order to perform deterministic shutdown of a machine? What is the information that you need in order to perform deterministic shutdown of a given machine?</p>

        <p>Can you have a generic method to perform deterministic shutdown or the methodology will be machine specific. These are a few natural questions one might ask when in search of a methodology to perform deterministic shutdown for a given machine. Once again, please remember, deterministic shutdown is a process where the machine is shutdown exactly at a desired time. The machine should not shut before or after that time for the shutdown to be deterministic.</p>

        <h3>What stops you from implementing deterministic shutdown?</h3>
        <p>Quantum mechanically it is well known that the natural measurement is a probabilistic process. This means there is always finite uncertainty when we measure. Although, this a problem because nature is not deterministic as per quantum mechanics. So, does this rule out deterministic shutdown?</p>

        <p>We don't know why natural measurement is probabilistic but, we certainly know that this can be a ramification of lack of information when try to define a probabilistic logical world. Here we need to define and determine the logical deterministic shutdown for our machine. We don't require that our machine be from the naturally observable physical world.</p>

        <p>To shutdown a machine in theory we must have info of all the variables of the machines completely. This calls for completeness of the information about the machine and its mechanisms. In reality we often utilize some basis to expand our systems, the completeness of the basis is an important factor in determining the system dynamics completely. This allows us to deduce that for a deterministic shutdown we must have all the information about the machine in hand.</p>

        <p>Now, let us think in the reverse manner, if we have all the information of the machine, this means that the machine has been deterministically shutdown. This is because quantum mechanically an observer is not separate from the experiment and hence having complete information about the experiment means having complete information of the observer. This means a completely self-aware observer on observation, observes a deterministic shutdown.</p>

        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>

        <p>In the previous note we discover that when the complete information for a system is known it often leads to deterministic shutdown if it has not already happened. The deterministic shutdown tries to talk about natural phenomenon by nature itself.</p>

        <h3>Myth of Isolation</h3>
        <p>For the study of natural phenomenon physicist have been known to assume the system at hand to be isolated. This assumption works but, is seen to be not working exactly. Not just there is a practical problem to this assumption but, there is a logical problem.</p>

        <p>In reality one cannot isolate a system and if that is done then all the external interactions with the system comes to an end. Often the observer is supposed to be external to the system, that's why measurement is the problem in Quantum mechanics. Otherwise the changes emerging due to the measurement process would not have been a problem. This is because the study would have consumed the observer as an integral part of the system and made it internal than external.</p>

        <p>This leads to the problem that we may know everything about the system but, not the observer. The system may have reached its shutdown but, it is the observation that keeps the system alive, this is also illustrated in cat's paradox. It is the myth of observation that destroys deterministic shutdown.</p>

        <h3>Is Nature observing itself?</h3>
        <p>If natural aliveness is dependent on the observer's observation and this is what keeps the nature alive then nature is naturally dead. But, death is another observation, isn't it? Hence, nature is neither alive nor dead, it is the myth emerging due to observation.</p>

        <p>Nature interacts within itself and if observer is no different than the un-isolatable nature by being a dependent sub-part, then the assumption of isolation is too strong and too wrong. Nature observes itself, which is what is interaction but, nature does not feel that it is differentiated, the mountain do not see itself as different than the river flowing through it. It is the limitations (or delimitation) that observer marks to mark pseudo boundaries in the system. These pseudo boundaries provides an incapable region to define the system exactly.</p>

        <h3>The problem with measurement.</h3>
        <p>The observer marking pseudo boundaries for isolation in order to measure is not unnatural but artificial. The myth here is that defining the system with the pseudo boundaries shall yield exact understanding and it does not happen, hence uncertainty (both quantum and classical).</p>

        <p>Yes, nature is interacting with itself and since the observer is natural it brings the notion of nature observing itself. This brings richness to the cat's paradox, that the outcome is dependent on the observer. If the observer is not completely self-aware this shall introduce uncertainty as observer cannot really know the bias induced in the system due to observation. Every observer shall have its own identity (not mathematical identity, but it is related) and this notion of self identification provides the observer this myth of isolation.</p>

        <p>Taking the limits we shall arrive to the conclusion that an observer must forgo all their identity in order to dissolve the notion of isolation. Hereby, the un-isolated observer becomes notion-less and this leads to an exact measurement.</p>

        <h3>Natural problem solving.</h3>
        <p>Nature in its natural evolution is not solving any problem rather it's only accepting the exact measurements as when it is not isolated why should it progress with the myth of isolation.</p>

        <p>To illustrate this natural phenomenon I propose the reader to imagine an examination hall. Let's assume two students are giving the examination and one of them has already solved the problem. The other one still needs to figure out the solution. In order to be correct and under-confident of being able to figure out the solution within the given time, the other student decides to cheat and copy the answer from his colleague. This is seen cheating but, it is a natural phenomenon.</p>

        <p>We call this cheating as we have isolated students into two, whereas they are still part of one connected system. So nature doesn't see this process as cheating but, this is the natural evolutionary route.</p>

        <p>The natural solution is solution itself. Since, the nature is not isolated, measurement is no longer a natural problem. And whatever the problem is the best solution shall be the natural solution which is the solution itself. This is because nature is composed of both the problem and the corresponding solution but, it cannot differentiate between the two. It is the observer that draws artificial boundaries begins this differentiation and in his own lack of self-awareness tries to make a measurement, making it a problem.</p>

        <p>This can be illustrated by doing a mental exercise. I urge my readers to imagine a chair. Now carefully understand that there was no mental time lag for the brain to create imagery of the chair. When the image was made it was instantaneous. The images will be different in all of our minds but, it came instantaneously which breaks causality. This is because no measurement/computation was performed at the mental level rather it was a spike as the natural brain followed the best solution.</p>
